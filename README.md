## CheckPass
Checkpass is an app script whcih will help you in finding the most secure password for your valuable accounts. CheckPass is capable of safely checking your password whether it has pawned or not. If yes, then how many times it has pawned.

Feel free to check your passwords because the password which user will enter will not be send directly to the API. The password firts would be encoded into SHA-256 code whihc is impossible to decode. In this way user will be safely able to select their passwords for their accounts.
